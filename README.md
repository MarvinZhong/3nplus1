3n + 1 program

- For example, if you enter 22, you get the number sequence: 22 11 34 17 52 26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1
- It is speculated that this algorithm will terminate for any integer (when 1 is printed). Although this algorithm is simple, it is impossible to know whether the above speculation is true. However, for all n (0 <n <1,000,000 ), the above speculation has been verified to be correct.
- Given an input n, we can get a sequence of numbers (1 as the end) through the above algorithm. The length of this sequence is called the cycle-length of n. In the example mentioned above, the cycle length of 22 is 16.
- The problem is here: for any two integers i, j, we want to know the largest number in the sequence of numbers between i and j (including i, j) What is the cycle length.
